The book has a rating of 4.07 out of 5 stars on Goodreads, based on 2,516 ratings and 108 reviews[^1^]. Most of the reviewers praised the book for its honesty, insight and emotion. They also appreciated Gerrard's humility, loyalty and dedication to his club and country.
 
For example, one reviewer wrote: \"This is the second autobiography from former Liverpool and England captain Steven Gerrard. Steven Gerrard doesn't need an introduction - but his insistence of staying a Liverpool over the span of an entire career is (unfortunately) of a dying breed. It's main focus is on the latter years, with flashback and comparisons to former years' highlights. [...] It's a great read for any Liverpool fan or football fan in general.\"[^2^]
 
Another reviewer wrote: \"There is little loyalty left in football; Gerrard is one of the last of his kind. My Story is a compelling, easy read. It reminded me of just how special Steven Gerrard was, as a person and a player. Itâs made me realise just how much Iâll miss seeing him in a Liverpool shirt.\"[^3^]
 
As you can see, *Gerrard: My Autobiography* is not only a book for Liverpool fans, but for anyone who loves football and admires Steven Gerrard. It is a book that will make you laugh, cry, cheer and reflect on the beautiful game and its challenges and joys.
