Once you have your characters ready, you can animate them with the motion capture and editing system.

You can also edit and refine your motions with the timeline and the curve editor. You can also add facial animations to your characters by using the facial animation system. You can either use the pre-made expressions and lip-syncs or create your own expressions and lip-syncs with the puppeteering and voice recording tools.
 
After you have your characters animated, you can create your scenes by using the scene creation system. You can either use the pre-made environments and props from the library or import your own assets from other sources. You can also adjust the lighting and shadow effects of your scenes with the lighting and shadow system. You can also add physics effects to your scenes with the physics engine. You can simulate realistic collisions, gravity, wind, fire, water, cloth, hair, and more.
