Anno 1404 is the sequel to Anno 1701 and is followed by the futuristic sequel Anno 2070. Though the game centers on a series of fictional events, the overall concept of the storyline is based upon real life aspects of medieval and renaissance history such as the Crusades, advancements in gothic architecture, construction of cathedrals, and hanseatic trade involving the rise of patrician merchants and early forms of capitalism[^3^].
 
The game features a sandbox mode where players can create their own custom scenarios, as well as a campaign mode that follows the story of a young Venetian noble who is sent to the Orient to help his family's trading empire. The game also introduces a new civilization, the Orientals, who have their own unique buildings, resources, and production chains. The game also allows players to interact with other players online through trading, diplomacy, or warfare[^3^].

One of the main features of Anno 1404 is the ability to build monumental structures, such as cathedrals, mosques, and pyramids. These structures require a large amount of resources, time, and population to complete, but they provide various benefits to the player, such as prestige, income, and satisfaction. The game also introduces the concept of ascension rights, which allow players to upgrade their population to higher classes with different needs and desires[^3^].
 
Another feature of Anno 1404 is the Venice expansion, which adds a new civilization, the Venetians, who have their own unique buildings, ships, and abilities. The expansion also adds new features such as espionage, sabotage, council elections, and volcanic islands. The expansion also allows players to play online with up to eight players in co-operative or competitive modes[^3^].
