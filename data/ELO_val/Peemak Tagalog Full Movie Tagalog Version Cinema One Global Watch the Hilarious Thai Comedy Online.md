Peemak is based on the legend of Mae Nak Phra Khanong, a famous Thai ghost story that has been adapted into various media forms over the years. The legend tells of a woman named Nak who died during childbirth while her husband Mak was away at war.

The film also explores the themes of love, loyalty, friendship, and forgiveness.
