Lords Of Football: United States is not only a DLC that adds a new league, but also a game that challenges your strategic and managerial skills. You will need to balance your footballers' training, tactics and lifestyle, as well as deal with their personalities, vices and distractions. You will also need to give them commands during the matches and watch them perform in a realistic 3D environment. Here are some tips and tricks that can help you master the game and become a successful lord of football:
 
- Use the drag and drop interface to assign your footballers to different training drills that improve their skills, such as passing, shooting, tackling and stamina. You can also customize your own drills by placing cones, balls and dummies on the training ground[^1^].
- Pay attention to your footballers' mood, morale and energy levels. They will affect their performance on and off the pitch. You can boost their mood by giving them praise, rewards or free time activities. You can also discipline them if they misbehave or break the rules[^1^].
- Manage your footballers' personal lives by choosing how they spend their free time. You can send them to the pub, club or restaurant for some fun, but be careful not to let them develop bad habits or addictions that can harm their health and career. You can also help them with their personal problems, such as relationships, family or money issues[^1^].
- Choose your tactics wisely before and during the matches. You can select your formation, style of play, set pieces and individual roles for each footballer. You can also give them commands in real time, such as pass, shoot, tackle or dribble. You can also pause the game and make substitutions or tactical changes[^1^].
- Learn some soccer moves and tricks that can help you beat any defender and create scoring chances. You can watch some tutorials on YouTube or read some articles online that teach you how to perform different skills, such as step overs, nutmegs, roulettes or rainbow flicks[^3^] [^4^].
- Unlock achievements by completing various tasks and challenges in the game. Some of them are easy, such as winning your first match or creating your team. Some of them are hard, such as winning a double or finishing a league unbeaten. Some of them are fun, such as having all your players addicted to a vice or making an epic comeback[^2^].

Lords Of Football: United States is a DLC that offers you a new and exciting way to experience the world of soccer. You can buy it now and enjoy the thrill of managing your own team in the USA National League.
