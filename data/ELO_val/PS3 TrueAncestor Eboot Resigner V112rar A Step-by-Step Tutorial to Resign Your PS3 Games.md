# How to Resign PS3 EBOOT and SPRX Files with TrueAncestor SELF Resigner
 
If you want to play PS3 games on your HEN-enabled console, you may need to resign the executable files (EBOOT.BIN and SPRX) to make them compatible with your system. One of the tools that can help you do that is TrueAncestor SELF Resigner by JjKkYu[^1^], a PC tool that can resign SELF/EBOOT.BIN and SPRX files for PS3.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use TrueAncestor SELF Resigner to resign PS3 EBOOT and SPRX files with ease. Follow these steps:

1. Download TrueAncestor SELF Resigner from the link provided in the reference section below[^1^]. Extract the zip file to a folder on your PC.
2. Copy the EBOOT.BIN and SPRX files that you want to resign to the \"original\" folder inside the TrueAncestor SELF Resigner folder.
3. Run \"TrueAncestor\_SELF\_Resigner.exe\" as administrator. You will see a menu with various options.
4. Select option 1 (Auto-resign EBOOT.BIN/Self/SPRX) and press Enter. The tool will automatically detect and resign the files in the \"original\" folder.
5. Wait for the process to finish. You will see a message saying \"Resign successful!\". The resigned files will be saved in the \"resigned\" folder inside the TrueAncestor SELF Resigner folder.
6. Copy the resigned files from the \"resigned\" folder to your PS3 via USB or FTP. Replace the original files with the resigned ones in the game folder.
7. Enjoy your game on your HEN-enabled PS3!

Note: This method may not work with all EBOOT and SPRX files, especially those that are meant for DEX systems or have special features. If you encounter any errors or issues, try using other tools such as Aldostools PS3 Tools collection[^2^] or ESSE Resigner[^2^]. You can also convert DEX EBOOTs to CEX using TrueAncestor SELF Resigner option 4 (Convert DEX EBOOT.BIN to CEX EBOOT.BIN).

## What is HEN and why do you need it for PS3?
 
HEN stands for Homebrew Enabler, which is an exploit that allows you to run homebrew applications and plugins on your PS3 without installing a custom firmware (CFW). HEN is a great alternative for those PS3 models that cannot install a CFW, such as the SuperSlim models and some Slim models that came later in the production line. HEN also has a lower ban risk than CFW, as it does not modify the system files permanently.
 
With HEN, you can enjoy many features that are similar to CFW, such as playing PS3, PS2, PS1 and PSP backups, using external storage devices, installing Retroarch for emulation, using file managers and FTP apps, and more. You can also access online services such as PSN and PS Store with HEN, but you need to be careful and use some precautions to avoid getting banned.
 
## How to install HEN on your PS3?
 
To install HEN on your PS3, you need to have a compatible firmware version and a special hybrid firmware (HFW) that restores the exploits that Sony patched in the official firmware updates. The latest version of HEN (v3.1.1) supports firmware 4.89.1 HFW, which you can download from the link provided in the reference section below[^3^]. Follow these steps to install HEN on your PS3:

1. Download the 4.89.1 HFW PUP file from the link provided in the reference section below[^3^]. Copy it to a USB drive formatted as FAT32. Create a folder named \"PS3\" on the root of the USB drive, and inside that folder create another folder named \"UPDATE\". Paste the PUP file inside the UPDATE folder and rename it as \"PS3UPDAT.PUP\".
2. Plug the USB drive into your PS3 and go to Settings > System Update > Update via Storage Media. Select the 4.89.1 HFW update and follow the instructions to install it. You may need to install it twice to make sure it is properly installed.
3. After installing the HFW, go to your PS3 web browser and visit ps3xploit.com/hen/installer/4.89/. You will see a page with some instructions and a button that says \"Initialize HEN Installer\". Click on that button and wait for a confirmation message.
4. After getting the confirmation message, click on the button that says \"Install HEN\". Wait for another confirmation message that says \"HEN Installed Successfully\".
5. Reboot your PS3 and go to Network > Hybrid Firmware Tools > Enable HEN. You will see a notification that says \"Welcome to PS3HEN v3.1.1\".
6. Congratulations! You have successfully installed HEN on your PS3. You can now run homebrew applications and plugins from the Game category on your XMB.

Note: To enable HEN every time you turn on your PS3, you need to go to Network > Hybrid Firmware Tools > Enable HEN again. Alternatively, you can install a HEN enabler package from the link provided in the reference section below[^4^], which will add a shortcut to enable HEN from the Game category on your XMB.
