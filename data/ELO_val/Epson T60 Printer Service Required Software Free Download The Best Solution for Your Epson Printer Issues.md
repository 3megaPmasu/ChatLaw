If you are using an Epson T60 printer and encounter the service required error, it means that your printer's waste ink pads are full and need to be replaced or reset. The waste ink pads are sponge-like components that absorb the excess ink during printing, cleaning, and maintenance. When they reach their capacity, the printer stops working and displays the error message.
 
There are two ways to fix this problem: either replace the waste ink pads or reset them using a software tool. Replacing the waste ink pads requires disassembling the printer and ordering new parts from Epson or a third-party supplier. This can be costly and time-consuming, especially if you are not familiar with the printer's structure.

A simpler and cheaper alternative is to use a software tool that can reset the waste ink pad counter and clear the error message. This way, you can continue using your printer without replacing the pads. However, you should be aware that this method does not remove the ink from the pads, so you should periodically check them for overflow and clean them if necessary.

Alternatively, you can replace the waste ink pads yourself or take your printer to a service center. You can also improve your printer's performance and lifespan by updating its firmware and cleaning its print head regularly.
