# How to Download and Install Siemens Tia Portal V11 with License Crack
 
Siemens Tia Portal V11 is a software package for programming PLCs of Siemens, such as S7-300, S7-400, and S7-1200. It is a powerful and user-friendly tool that allows you to create, configure, and monitor your automation projects. However, it is not free and requires a valid license key to run.
 
If you want to try Siemens Tia Portal V11 without buying a license key, you can download the trial version from the official website[^1^] and use a license crack to activate it. In this article, we will show you how to do that step by step.

## Step 1: Download Siemens Tia Portal V11 SP2 Trial
 
The trial version of Siemens Tia Portal V11 SP2 is available for registered customers on the Siemens support website[^2^]. You can register for free and download the software for 21 days. The download link is https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/106449434.
 
The trial version consists of several parts that you need to download separately. They are:
 
- STEP7\_V11\_SP2\_Basic\_Part.1
- STEP7\_V11\_SP2\_Basic\_Part.2
- WinCC\_V11\_SP2\_Comfort\_Advanced\_Part.1
- WinCC\_V11\_SP2\_Comfort\_Advanced\_Part.2
- WinCC\_V11\_SP2\_Professional\_Part.1
- WinCC\_V11\_SP2\_Professional\_Part.2

You can choose which parts you need depending on your requirements. For example, if you only need STEP 7 Basic, you can download only the first two parts.
 
## Step 2: Install Siemens Tia Portal V11 SP2 Trial
 
After downloading all the parts, you need to extract them using a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip. The password for extraction is plc247.com[^1^]. You will get several ISO files that you need to mount or burn to a DVD.
 
To install Siemens Tia Portal V11 SP2 Trial, you need to run the setup.exe file from the STEP7\_V11\_SP2\_Basic folder. Follow the instructions on the screen and choose the components you want to install. You will also need to enter your customer data and agree to the terms and conditions.
 
The installation process may take some time depending on your system configuration and the components you selected. After the installation is complete, you can launch Siemens Tia Portal V11 from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut.
 
## Step 3: Apply Siemens Tia Portal V11 License Crack
 
To activate Siemens Tia Portal V11 without a valid license key, you need to use a license crack that can bypass the license check. There are several sources where you can find such cracks, such as Peatix[^3^] or PDF files[^4^]. However, we do not recommend using them as they may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or compromise your data.
