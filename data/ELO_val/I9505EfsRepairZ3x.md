EFS folder is a partition on your phone that stores important information such as IMEI, serial number, baseband version, network settings, and encryption keys. It is essential for your phone to function properly and connect to the network. If you lose or corrupt your EFS folder, you may face problems such as invalid IMEI, null IMEI, no network signal, no service, or unable to make or receive calls.
 
There are several reasons why your EFS folder may get lost or corrupted. Some of them are:

- Flashing a custom ROM or firmware that is not compatible with your phone model or region.
- Rooting your phone or installing a custom recovery that modifies the system partition.
- Using a third-party app or tool that accesses or changes the EFS folder without proper permission or backup.
- Physical damage to your phone or memory card that affects the EFS partition.

Therefore, it is advisable to always backup your EFS folder before performing any modifications to your phone. You can use tools like Z3X Samsung Tool Pro, EFS Professional, or Samsung Tool to backup and restore your EFS folder easily. You can also use apps like EFS Backup or EFS IMEI Backup to backup your EFS folder on your phone or SD card.
