The History of Macarena Dance
 
Macarena is not only a song, but also a dance that has become a global phenomenon. The dance originated in Latin America, by a Spanish duo named Los Del RÃ­o[^4^]. The duo was inspired by a flamenco dancer named Diana Patricia CubillÃ¡n, who impressed them with her moves at a party in Venezuela. They decided to name the song after Antonio Romero's daughter, Esperanza Macarena[^2^].
 
The original version of Macarena was a flamenco song that was released in 1993 and became a hit in Spain. However, it was not until 1995 that the song reached international fame, thanks to a remix by the Bayside Boys, who added English lyrics and a dance beat. The remix was played on American radio stations and soon became a sensation. The song spent 14 weeks at the top of the Billboard charts, making it one of the longest reigning songs in history[^2^].
