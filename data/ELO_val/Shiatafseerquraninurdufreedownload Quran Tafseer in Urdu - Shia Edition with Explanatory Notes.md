Shia Muslims believe that the Quran is the word of God revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the angel Gabriel. They also believe that the Quran has an inner meaning (ta'wil) that can only be understood by the Imams, who are the divinely appointed successors of the Prophet. The Imams have explained the Quran through their teachings and narrations, which are collected in various books of tafseer (exegesis).
 
One of the most popular and authentic Shia tafseer books is Tafseer al-Mizan by Allamah Muhammad Husayn Tabatabai, who was a renowned scholar and philosopher of the 20th century. He wrote this tafseer in Arabic, based on the principles of rationality, logic, and coherence. He also used various sources of Shia hadith (traditions) to support his interpretations.
