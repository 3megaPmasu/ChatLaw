# Chaar Sahibzaade: The Unforgettable History of Sikh Heroism and Sacrifice
 
Chaar Sahibzaade, (âChaarâ means four and âSahibzaadeâ refers to the sons or scions, young men of genteel birth) is a term endearingly used for the four sons of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the 10th guru of the Sikhs. [^7^] They are revered for their courage, bravery and martyrdom in the face of tyranny and oppression by the Mughal Empire.

- Sahibzada Ajit Singh (1687-1704), the eldest son, who fought valiantly in the Battle of Anandpur and the Battle of Chamkaur, where he attained martyrdom along with his brother Jujhar Singh and 40 other Sikhs.
- Sahibzada Jujhar Singh (1691-1704), the second son, who also displayed great heroism in the Battle of Chamkaur and sacrificed his life for his faith.
- Sahibzada Zorawar Singh (1696-1705), the third son, who was captured along with his younger brother Fateh Singh by the Mughal governor of Sirhind, Wazir Khan. They were tortured and executed by being bricked alive in a wall for refusing to convert to Islam.
- Sahibzada Fateh Singh (1699-1705), the youngest son, who showed remarkable courage and steadfastness in facing death at the tender age of six.

The story of Chaar Sahibzaade is not only a tale of tragedy and sacrifice, but also a source of inspiration and pride for Sikhs all over the world. It is a testament to the spirit of Khalsa, which was founded by Guru Gobind Singh Ji to uphold the principles of justice, equality and freedom for all. The legacy of Chaar Sahibzaade lives on in the hearts and minds of Sikhs as they remember their glorious history and pay homage to their martyrs.

The martyrdom of Chaar Sahibzaade is commemorated every year by Sikhs in various ways. Some of the common practices are:

- Reciting the Sikh scriptures and hymns that narrate the lives and deeds of the four Sahibzaade.
- Organizing special programs and events at gurdwaras and other places to pay tribute to the martyrs and educate the younger generation about their history.
- Participating in processions and rallies that display the portraits and banners of the four Sahibzaade and other Sikh heroes.
- Performing acts of charity and service to help the needy and promote the values of Sikhism.

The significance of Chaar Sahibzaade is not only limited to the Sikh community, but also extends to the wider world. Their story is a universal example of courage, faith, loyalty and sacrifice that transcends religious boundaries. Their martyrdom is a symbol of resistance against tyranny and oppression, and a source of inspiration for all those who seek justice and freedom. Their legacy is a reminder of the importance of human dignity and rights, and a challenge to uphold them in the face of adversity.

The impact of Chaar Sahibzaade is immense and profound on the Sikh history and culture. Their martyrdom marked a turning point in the Sikh struggle against the Mughal oppression and paved the way for the rise of the Khalsa Raj under Banda Singh Bahadur, who avenged the atrocities committed by Wazir Khan and his allies. Their martyrdom also inspired countless Sikhs to follow their example and sacrifice their lives for their faith and nation.
 
The Chaar Sahibzaade are also celebrated and honoured in various forms of art and media. Their story has been depicted in paintings, literature, music, theatre, films and animation. Some of the notable works based on their lives are:

- The film Chaar Sahibzaade (2014) directed by Harry Baweja, which was the first 3D animated film on Sikh history and became a huge commercial and critical success.
- The film Chaar Sahibzaade: Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur (2016) directed by Harry Baweja, which was a sequel to the first film and focused on the aftermath of the martyrdom of Chaar Sahibzaade.
- The book The Four Sons of Guru Gobind Singh (2018) written by Navtej Sarna, which was a historical novel based on extensive research and sources.
- The play Chaar Sahibzaade (2019) directed by Kewal Dhaliwal, which was a musical drama that portrayed the life and sacrifice of Chaar Sahibzaade.

The Chaar Sahibzaade are not only historical figures, but also spiritual guides and role models for Sikhs and non-Sikhs alike. They embody the values of courage, devotion, loyalty and sacrifice that are essential for any human being. They teach us to stand up for our beliefs and principles, even if it means facing death. They show us how to live with dignity and honour, even in the most difficult circumstances. They remind us of our duty to serve humanity and protect the weak and oppressed. They inspire us to follow the path of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and become true Khalsa.
