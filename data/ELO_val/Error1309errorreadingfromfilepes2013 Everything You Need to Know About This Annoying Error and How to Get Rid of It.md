### Check and Correct User Permissions
 
If you do not have full control over the folder where PES 2013 is being installed, you may encounter error 1309. To check and correct user permissions, follow these steps:

1. Locate the folder in which PES 2013 is being installed (the default path is C:\Program Files\Konami\).
2. Right-click the folder and select Properties.
3. If your name or the name of your user group is not listed under Group or user names, click Edit and add your name or group.
4. If Full Control is not selected under Permissions for SYSTEM, click Edit and select Full Control.
5. Click Apply or OK to save your edits.
6. Try to install PES 2013 again.

### Shorten the File Path Length
 
If the path to either the source folder or the destination folder has more than 256 characters, Windows may not be able to read the file correctly and cause error 1309. To shorten the file path length, follow these steps:

1. Check the number of characters in the full Windows path to the source folder containing the files from which youâre installing. Also check the number of characters in the path leading to the destination folder in which youâre installing PES 2013. You can copy the path into a Word file and select Review tab > Word Count to see the number of words and characters.
2. If either path is longer than 256 characters, shorten it. One way to shorten the path to the source folder is to run PES 2013 installer from a folder on your C drive rather than from your desktop. For example, run PES 2013 installer from C:\PES2013.
3. Try to install PES 2013 again.

### Download the Complete Installation Package of PES 2013
 
If none of the above solutions work, it is possible that your PES 2013 installation package is corrupted or incomplete. To fix this, you need to download a new copy of PES 2013 from a reliable source. You can either download it from [Konami's official website](https://www.konami.com/wepes/2021/us/en-us/all/page/download) or from a trusted third-party website such as [FilePlanet](https://www.fileplanet.com/archive/p-16103/Pro-Evolution-Soccer-2013-Patch). Make sure you have enough disk space and a stable internet connection before downloading.
